Description
============
Calculations of the pyroelectric coefficient by using the Sharp-Garn approach.
Script reads data files of a predefined form and decides by applied thermal excitation which algorhytm for the pyroelectric coefficient has to be used.
Here, also p and p(T) can be evaluated by providing the respective date files.
The script plots raw as well as fitted datasets.
Furthermore, poling and resistance measurements can be evaluated and plotted.
