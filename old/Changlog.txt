# 2013-07-19:	-Creation date
# 2013-07-23:	-finishing implementation of SineWave, SineWave+LinRamp, AutoPol
#		    	-SineWave+LinRamp uses now a interpolation of the data to get all data on the save time grid
# 2013-07-25:	-enhanced console output for AutoPol, SineWave, SineWave+LinRamp
#		     	-correct filenames for figures
#		     	-correct filenames for txts
#		     	-exp. fit of AutoPol Current with graphical input
# 2013-07-28:	-activated ion(), ioff() when shell was not started with --pylab
# 2013-07-29:	-Triangle/SineWave+Triangle profiles plotting implemented
# 2013-08-02:	-implententation of OnPerm Modes (Thermostat, SineWave (for STO crystal))
# 2013-08-05:	-modifified Inp/Ip calculation in SineWave, .... to abs() in order to make amplitude postive and drawing of fits correct!
#		     	-Thermostat for HV Off section
# 2013-08-09:	-improved plot and fit for STO samples (right TSC phase with phase shifts of 360, 180 and 0 degree)
#		     	-LaTeX text in textbox SineWave (HVOff, HVOn)
#		     	-interpolation on SineWave data (HVOff, HVOn)
#		     	-correct filename for output in SineWave method
# 2013-08-14:	-partial implementation of SineWave+TriangHat method
#		     	-optimized SineWave+LinRamp routine (fit and plot beginning at start_index=100) + filtering of I>1muA before plotting!
#		     	-method for save figure
#		     	-copied new SineWave+LinRamp to "HV_on" part
#		     	-fixed phase for pyro current plot when phasediff >180
# 2013-08-16:	-fixed HV Comp readout!
# 2013-09-27:	-fixed reading error in HVlog for OnPerm measurements
# 2013-10-01:	-fixed interpolation in AutoPol (tnew was to large --> tnew will caculated from Imin to HVmax time)

# 2013-12-16:	-exported Changelog to seperate File "Changelog.txt"
				-added filtering of 0.015mA and 9.9+39 values of currents when file is read
				-current_filter_flag and temp_filter_flag to check if current filtering was applied and if second PT100 works correct!
				-variable for upper_I Limit (upper_I_lim), for filtering of certain current values
# 2014-01-09:	-fixed offset start_paramter for Sin-Fit in SineWave
				-added I-Lim for plot in SineWave
# 2014-02-38:	-updated user variable section in head of script
				-extract_fit_rel_params() - now with return of Fit lists (in the past no return)
				-erased phase calibration stuff
				-new filter method for current - method of Carsten (ind> ...) when reading files, filtering of 0.015, 9.9e39 and upper_I_lim
				-function for finding interpolation range
				-title_size, label_size variables for plot
				-fit lists (Tfit_low, ...) are now globaly defined (not separate in each part)
				-degrees() function from pylab instead of 180/pi
				-dpi, transparency in saving_fig() as global variables
				-interpolation function for T and I with global steps-variable and temp_filter_flag (one function for all parts)
				-plot_graph() function for plotting after readings files (returns bild, ax1, ax2 for further use)
# 2014-03-05:	-3 digits box text in sine wave
				-new legend layout and integrated into plot_graph() for 1x PT100
				-all legend boxes on top in sine wave method, with ax2.add_artist(leg1)
				-single crystal variable, makes phasediff=90deg in sinewave method
# 2014-04-03:	-box_text function to generate anchored box with measurement information
				-fontsize_box global parameter
				-deleted box_alpha global parameter, becaue AnchordedText has no alpha attribute
